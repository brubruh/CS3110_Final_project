Outlining 5-Minute Cells Script


Speaker A (Cells 1–6: intro, imports, config, raw data, DP mechanisms, privacy checks)

“We start with the goals: generate synthetic location data that preserves patterns while providing differential privacy, plus extra safeguards like k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness.”

“Imports and helpers define Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms, plus percent-error utilities. We set a DPConfig for reproducibility—grid size, epsilon budgets for counts and release, jitter noise, and privacy thresholds.”

“The raw dataset is synthetic: we place metro centers and sprinkle additional towns, then sample 10,000 users with city-specific weights. Each user is jittered around their home center with Gaussian and Laplace drift, giving a realistic but non-private baseline.”

“Step 2 grids the bounding box. We compute true grid counts, then add Laplace noise (dp_counts) and separately Gaussian noise (gauss_counts). From each noisy grid we sample synthetic points (syn_df for Laplace, gauss_syn_df for Gaussian) and jitter around cell centers.”

“Step 3 applies bucketization by nearest metro. We run k-anonymity and l-diversity on those buckets, and t-closeness via JS divergence. We produce a small table privacy_checks comparing Laplace and Gaussian variants.”


Speaker B (Cells 7–end: utility, visuals, bucket tables, percent error, comparisons, iteration)

“Step 4 is utility: JS divergence on bucket distributions and average spatial error (km) for each variant, shown in utility_report.”

“Step 5 visualizes raw vs Laplace vs Gaussian as side-by-side scatters on shared axes to eyeball geographic fidelity.”

“Next, bucket counts table shows raw, DP Laplace, and DP Gaussian counts per city—helpful to see aggregate shifts.”

“The percent-error cell plots city-level percent error bars and grid-cell error histogram for the Laplace run, plus printed mean bucket and grid percent errors.”

“A comparison cell rebuilds both mechanisms and bar-plots mean bucket/grid percent errors across Laplace vs Gaussian.”

“There’s also an iterative averages cell (if you run it) that repeats draws to report average absolute and percent differences per city across multiple seeds—useful to smooth randomness.”

“Takeaway: Laplace and Gaussian both preserve coarse patterns; privacy checks are met under current thresholds; utility shows modest JS and spatial error. Adjust epsilon_counts or jitter to trade privacy for accuracy, and rerun cells 2–5 to update all tables and plots.”
