Final project for CS3110
This project will be a jupyter notebook, that has a series of functions. Some of the cells will need to be run in order for the files to work.

The bottom cells will display graphs of the plots for comparisons between the different DP algorithms we use.

The top cells will be the import functions and algorithms use.

For this project we will use k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness on locations. 




can you use the @README.md as a framework for a differential privacy project that follows these guidelines:  build a complete system that accomplishes a realistic task while ensuring differential privacy, we need you to make the geographical user location syntethic data. Make it all one file in the style of a notebook.
